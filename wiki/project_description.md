## This section contains a more detailed explanation of the nuances of the work of this project

### Use of the service by those wishing to provide the opportunity to book resources

Before performing the actions necessary to provide the opportunity to book anything, you must register the user in
the system. Before performing the actions necessary to provide the opportunity to book anything, you must register 
the user in the system. Only by having a user in the system and having completed authorization by providing the 
necessary user data will you be able to gain access to those sections that allow you to place resources for booking.
The first thing you need to do is add the location of the service. Next, you need to add a service in this location,
which will correspond to certain resources that will be rented out. For example, the service is billiards, but we rent
out not billiards, but a specific billiard table and there may be several of them in a certain place. In order to 
out a resource, it is necessary to create times available for renting.

The service also provides the ability to search for reserved times. The search is carried out according to the 
parameters that you want to use as filters. It is also possible to arrange the displayed results according to any 
criteria and in the desired order.

### Using the service from the client side

The client receives a link to a web page containing a form for selecting what he wants to book. It is assumed that the 
client will receive the link somewhere on the side, for example, on the companyâ€™s Facebook page. All actions performed
by the client to book a resource do not require authorization. By clicking on the link, the client must select the 
place where he wants to book something in the future. Having selected a place, a service available in this place and a
date, the client will receive times available for booking, which he can subsequently book.
